# Navigating the IFS {#navigating-the-ifs}

When you log in you are placed in a PASE shell and also into a directory in the IFS. Previously we used `pwd` to print the current working directory. You can also use the `ls` \(list\) command to display the contents of a directory.

Try the `ls` command for yourself and you should see something like the below.

```
~% ls
~%
```

Nothing was listed because the directory is empty. Well, that’s only partially true. I just so happen to know there are "hidden" files in this directory. Hidden files start with a period and aren’t displayed by default. Most all PASE commands have options that let you expound on what you want the command to do. The PASE commands delivered with the IBM i operating system lack what are called "man pages", or manual pages, the documentation for the command. Because of this we instead head to google and search for " [ls command](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ls1.html) ".

In the documentation we see the `-a` option, as shown below.

```
       -a, --all
              do not hide entries starting with .
```

Now re-run the `ls` command with the `-a` option.

```
~% ls -a
.          ..         .ssh       .zprofile
```

As you can see there are two hidden entries, `.ssh` is a hidden directory and `.zprofile` is a hidden file. You’ll also notice `.` and `..` \(a single and double period\). These are for when you want to use relative paths in your commands.

For example, if I wanted to change my current directly to that of my parent directory then I could issue the `cd` \(change directory\) command.

```
% cd ..
/home%
```

Notice how this changes the current directory in my prompt to `/home`. Previously I was in my home directory \(i.e. `/home/USRZ8IGS`\) and it simply used `~`.

I can run the `ls` command again to see my home directory \(i.e. `USRZ8IGS`\) because it is a child directory of the `/home` directory.

```
/home% ls
USRZ8IGS
```

Now try to list the contents of the root directory. The root is the single forward slash \(`/`\).

```
~% ls /
QOpenSys  dev       home      opt       tmp       var
bin       etc       lib       sbin      usr
```
